# About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on Rust, always looking for ways to build fast, reliable, and scalable solutions. I’m passionate about backend development and love using technology to solve real-world problems, whether it’s automating tasks, optimizing performance, or building custom tools.
## What I've Worked On:

### Rust:
  - Built WebSocket servers for real-time communication, ensuring speed and reliability.
  - Created a personal CLI tool for server management, storing data locally to streamline everyday tasks.
  - I leverage Rust's performance and safety features to develop efficient solutions in automation and beyond.

### Python:
  - Developed fast, scalable APIs using FastAPI for real-world applications.
  - Automated PDF data extraction with PyMuPDF (fitz), saving time and reducing manual work.

### Automation & Cloud:
  - Automated workflows and integrated with AWS, making infrastructure management simpler and more efficient.

### Other Tools: 
  - Experienced with Node.js, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and building APIs and distributed systems.

Currently, I'm enhancing my Linux skills as I prepare for the CompTIA Linux+ certification, furthering my expertise in server administration and production environments.

I’m always excited to take on new challenges where I can use my skills to create practical solutions—whether that’s designing APIs, developing custom tools, or automating tasks that make life easier.
